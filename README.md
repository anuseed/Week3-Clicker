# Required

-What requirements did you achieve?- Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

I was able to add an event listener and handler to the cookie button which showed how many clicks the user had made.
I was also able to get the data from the API and parse it to the page.

I added a setInterval to the cookie counter to keep adding 1 cookie per second.

I used the local storage workshop to help me understand how to log the cookies count to the local storage and save this so that the user does not loose their cookie count when they close the page.I also encountered an error which returned null when the user first uses the cookie clicker as there is no cookie count stored in local storage.

I made a reset button which cleared the cookie count and set cookiesPerSecond back to 1.

Using the id from the buy button to add buy items and add value to the cookiesPerSecond value was an absolute rollercoaster. I really struggled with this one! My husband gave me some really good basic lessons in loops and finding items in an array, but super tricky for me to get my head around. Really happy it finally works.

Styling elements created in JS(from the Shop Ugrades) was very tricky, I didn't know how to reference these items in css. I was busy trying to style the media queries but messed up my page and now have run out of time. Will see if I can fix this before the deadline.

This was an incredibly hard assignment for me, I didn't enjoy a lot of it. It made me feel like I just didn't get anything. I liked doing the CSS and enjoy styling the page but the JS was hard. I am very grateful to have someone around the house to help me understand concepts and occasionaly debug but without which I would have really struggled to get any of this done.

-If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
I have a lot of gaps in my understanding of JS, this makes it really difficult to know how to start, comments and instructions given in the skeleton where useful to an extent but for some aspects I had too many gaps in my understanding to complete them. I know what I want to achieve but my basic foundation of JS is not good enough to implement any of this. Trying to figure this out on my own without a lot of external help was next to impossible. Spending hours googling, going over the workshops and reading the JS book I bought was not sufficient and for my own mental health I did not want to continue as it was making me feel terrible. I had to take lots of breaks and try get the right mindset again to try again. I am hopeful with more exposure I can get better and I will continue reading the book on JS I got which has been very helpful in solidifying some concepts but I have only covered the first two chapters.
