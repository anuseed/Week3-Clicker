# Required

-What requirements did you achieve?- Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

I was able to add an event listener and handler to the cookie button which showed how many clicks the user had made.
I was also able to get the data from the API and parse it to the page.

I added a setInterval to the cookie counter to keep adding 1 cookie per second.

I used the local storage workshop to help me understand how to log the cookies count to the local storage and save this so that the user does not loose their cookie count when they close the page.I also encountered an error which returned null when the user first uses the cookie clicker as there is no cookie count stored in local storage.

I made a reset button which cleared the cookie count.

I was also unable to make the buy buttons work and add the amount to cookies pers second to change how many cookies the user gets per click. My husband gave me a really good lesson in for loops and finding objects in the array (his commments are in the js) but I had to give up after a point as I just wasn't able to get it to work. The whole process just felt incredibly overwhelming.

Styling elements created in JS(from the Shop Ugrades) was very tricky, I didn't know how to reference these items in css. Creating a div around the element in HTML made it all dissapear so I left it as is.

I have purposefully left this assignment here rather than ask for more help to avoid doing something I don't really understand. I feel it is important to acknowledge that this is the extent of my knowledge currently and rather than spend more time on this I will try and finish reading the JS book I got, going over examples and so on.

-If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
I have a lot of gaps in my understanding of JS, this makes it really difficult to know how to start, comments and instructions given in the skeleton where useful to an extent but for some aspects I had too many gaps in my understanding to complete them. I know what I want to achieve but my basic foundation of JS is not good enough to implement any of this. Trying to figure this out on my own without a lot of external help was next to impossible. Spending hours googling, going over the workshops and reading the JS book I bought was not sufficient and for my own mental health I did not want to continue as it was making me feel terrible. I am hopeful with more exposure I can get better and I will continue reading the book on JS I got which has been very helpful in solidifying some concepts but I have only covered the first two chapters. I am going to leave the cookie clicker here for now.
