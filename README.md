# Required

-What requirements did you achieve?- Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

I was able to add an event listener and handler to the cookie button which showed how many clicks the user had made.
I was also able to get the data from the API and parse it to the page.

I was unable to add a timer to the cookies per second.

I was unable to log the cookies count to the local storage and save this so that the user does not loose their cookie count when they close the page.

I was also unable to make the buy buttons work and add the amount to cookies pers second to change how many cookies the user gets per click.

-If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
I do not have a good understanding of JS. I know what I want to achieve but my basic foundation of JS is not good enough to implement any of this. Trying to figure this out on my own without a lot of external help was next to impossible. Spending hours googling, going over the workshops and reading the JS book I bought was not sufficient and for my own mental health I did not want to continue as it was making me feel terrible. I am hopeful with more exposure I can get better and I will continue reading the book on JS I got which has been very helpful in solidifying some concepts but I have only covered the first two chapters. I am going to leave the cookie clicker here for now.
